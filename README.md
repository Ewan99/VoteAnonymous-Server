This project is an implementation of a Zero-Knowledge Proof system using “Schnorr's Identification Protocol” that validates the authorization of an individual for the purpose of casting their vote during a political election through our Android app on a mobile phone/tablet. The goal of this application is to honour the principles of privacy possible using ZKP to allow for a voter remain anonymous to the system while casting their vote securely.

The partner android application is needed to interact with the server. https://github.com/DerrickMilford/VoteAnonymous-Android
